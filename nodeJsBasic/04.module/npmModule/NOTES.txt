Initial file in this folder :
-> app.js
-> ownModule.js
-> NOTES.txt

after do 'npm init', then : (create this folder as npm package)
+ package.json

after it do 'npm i {package}@{version}', then : (here I used 'npm i validator@latest')
+ package-lock.json
+ node_modules
+ package.json (add new dependencies)

if we delete 'npm_modules' folder, we can't import dependencies modules. Do "npm install" command and npm will install all dependencies that include in "package.json".

=====================================================

We can install package locally in our computer, so we can use it every where in our computer (would be not written in package.json).
We can do it with 'npm i {package}@{version} -g'.
One tools that maybe we need to install globally is like "nodemon" package for realtime change after we save the change.
